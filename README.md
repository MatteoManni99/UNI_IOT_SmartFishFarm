In this project, I developed a smart environment using IoT techniques. The use case is an aquaculture system. Naturally, many things were simplified. I worked with five sensors and used ContikiNG as sensor operating system. One of them is also employed as RPL Border Router for the device network, while the other four devices simulate the following: temperature (sensor), water quality (sensor), heat pump (actuator), and water filter (actuator). The communication protocols involved are MQTT and CoAP. The project is basically divided into two parts: the sensor network, developed in C, and the control application, developed in Java.

For more details, you can refer to the documentation.
