# UNI_IOT_SmartFishFarm_
In this project I developed a Smart Evironment throught IoT techincs. The use case is an aquaculture system. Obviously a lot of things were simplified.
I worked with 5 sensors and ContikiNG as OS for the latter. One of them is used as a RPL Border Router of the device network, the other 4 device simulate respectively: temperature (sensor), water quality (sensor), heat pump (actuator), water filter (actuator).
The communication protocol involved are MQTT and CoAP.

For more details you can check the documentation.
